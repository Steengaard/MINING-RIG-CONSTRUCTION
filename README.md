CRYPTOCURRENCY MINING RIGS (Build from step 1)

My latest interests is how to put together and make Cryptocurrency Mining Rigs...
Atm. All my research is that only GPU & ASIC mining is profitable...
Electric Power is to expensive in DK, to make it profitable. 
DK price pr. 1 (one) KW/h is atm. Dkk: 2.35 = 0.39 USD
So NOT a very good investment, if one plans to mine with these prices...
But never mind that... Mining is going on elsewhere outside DK, wher power is a lot more cheep..

You are welcome to leave a note with YOUR experience about, what is right to do, and not...
Especialy if it is about assambley of Mining rigs, and issues that connects to this subject...

ENJOY...
